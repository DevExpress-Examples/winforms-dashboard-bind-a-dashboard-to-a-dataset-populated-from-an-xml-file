# BI Dashboard for WinForms - How to Load XML Data from a File at Runtime

This example contains a dashboard bound to an object data source with fake data whose structure is defined by an XML schema. The actual data is loaded at runtime from an XML file.

To load the data, click the **Load Data** custom button in the [dashboard title](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15618/creating-dashboards/creating-dashboards-in-the-winforms-designer/dashboard-layout/dashboard-title). The button is created by handling the [CustomizeDashboardTitle](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.CustomizeDashboardTitle) event.
Its click action calls the [DashboardViewer.ReloadData](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.ReloadData) method that triggers the [DashboardViewer.DataLoading](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.DataLoading) event. The actual data are obtained within the event handler and assigned to the [e.Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardCommon.DataLoadingEventArgs.Data) property.
